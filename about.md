The _Go_ _Make_ _Friends_ podcast tells stories about people working together. They aren't necessarily big stories about big challenges or triumphs. They're about how day-to-day cooperation is difficult and necessary.  I hope that some listeners will be inspired to get out there and get involved with others; to be creative and courageous in their dealings with other people; and to approach our problems with a spirit of friendship.

### Among other things I'm interested in how groups...

* resolve conflicts,
* find leaders,
* model themselves after other groups,
* measure success,
* plan for the future.
