The Go Make Friends podcast has a goal: to celebrate group activity by telling stories about people working together. Often people only really hear about organizations in the media when they make headlines with big stories. I want to present something that gives a sense of what's it's like and how rewarding it can be to work with other people. I think that those kinds of stories, about what day-to-day life in organizations can be, are very important. I hope that some listeners will be inspired to get out there and get involved, and to be creative and courageous in their dealings with other people.

### Among other things I'm interested in how groups...

* Resolve conflicts,
* Find leaders,
* Model themselves after other groups,
* Measure success,
* Plan for the future.
